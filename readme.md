# cTensor
The cTensor (crafted tensor) is a super light-weight deep learning library (perhaps we cannot even call it a libray). It's based on numpy and furthermore its only one dependency is actually numpy. Features include dynamic graph, autograd and user-defined operations in numpy. The line number of core code is within 300, making it friendly for study and teaching purpose. It mimics PyTorch framework defacto. Of course, cTensor has not yet support convolutional operations. Stars are welcomed! :)
