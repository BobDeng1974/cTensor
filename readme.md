# cTensor
The cTensor (crafted tensor) is a super light-weight deep learning library (perhaps we cannot even call it a libray). It's based on numpy and furthermore its only one dependency is actually numpy. Features include dynamic graph, autograd and user-defined operations in numpy. The line number of core code is within 300, making it friendly for study and teaching purpose. It mimics PyTorch framework defacto.

We have supported batch __conv2d__ in pytorch fashion operation (limited in stride 1, no padding) !!

Stars are welcomed! :)
